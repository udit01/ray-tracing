Summary of Blog 4 READ


Section 1: Representation of surfaces

- Parametric and Implicit
- Sphere useful as a bounding volume. Intersection testing surfaces.
    > First compute if interect with the sphere, faster if finding intersection 
    with Implicit surfaces is faster than a triangle mesh.

- solution with ray-Implicit surface is simpler, faster and used as bounding volumes.

- intersection is easier than other components in differential geometry.
Different approach in production.

Section 2: Ray Sphere intersection

- Geometrical solution 
    > Found by tangets and angles between lines.
- Anylytical solution 
    > Implicit Functions and Modelling
    > But found by roots of quadratic equation.
- Pay attention to normalization of direction vectors during implementation.

- Find the intersection point by the ray parametric equation.
(Did not understand why the wrong is wrong and good is good in the last image)

Section 3 : Rendering spheres

Heirarchy of Functions
> Intersect defined inside sphere using prev
> Trace, gets the nearest point where hit , given a ray
> Cast ray also calculates the texture information, the checkboard pattern

Section 4: Ray plane intersection

Simple geometry with the normal
Additional constratins for disk

Section 5 : Ray box interection 

Using geomentry and parametric form , 
(didn't explain for oblique boxes) but we can just tranform the ray.
